# express-named-routes

  Route storage, lookup and conversion to usable paths.

  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/RGBboy/express-named-routes.png)](http://travis-ci.org/RGBboy/express-named-routes)

## Installation

  Works with Express 3.0.x

    $ npm install express-named-routes

## Usage

  Simply invoke the `extend()` method on an Express server to add this functionality.

```javascript
var app = require('express')(),
    namedRoutes = require('express-named-routes');

namedRoutes.extend(app);
```

## Defining and Looking Up Routes

  Routes can be defined via `app.defineRoute(routeName, routeDefinition)`:

```javascript

app.defineRoute('signin', '/signin');
```

  Routes can be retrieved via `app.lookupRoute(routeName)`:

```javascript

app.lookupRoute('signin'); // returns '/signin'
```

  You may also pass in an object containing nested routes:

```javascript

app.defineRoute('resource', {
  index: '/resource',
  show: '/resource/:param',
  edit: '/resource/:param/edit'
});
```

  Looking up a route that points to an object containing multiple routes will return the
  route object:

```javascript

app.lookupRoute('resource'); // returns { index: '/resource', show: '/resource/:param', edit: '/resource/:param/edit' }
```

  To lookup nested routes use the `.` notation:

```javascript

app.lookupRoute('resource.index'); // returns '/resource';
app.lookupRoute('resource.show'); // returns '/resource/:param';
app.lookupRoute('resource.edit'); // returns '/resource/:param/edit;
```

## Converting routes to usable paths (URLS)

  A helper function is added to your request object to convert a route to a usable path.
  You can use this via `req.routeToPath(routeName)`.

```javascript

app.defineRoute('signin', '/signin');

app.get('/some/other/route', function (req, res, next) {
  var linkToSignin = req.routeToPath('signin'); // '/signin'
  next();
});
```

  If the route contains params, these will be replaced by the params
  for current route. You may optionally override these by passing in an
  object containing the param name as a key and a value to override with:

```javascript

app.defineRoute('resource', '/resource/:resourceId');

app.get(app.lookupRoute('resource'), function (req, res, next) {
  var resourceId = req.params.resourceId;
  var currentResourcePath = req.routeToPath('resource'); // e.g. '/resource/1'
  var nextResourcePath = req.routeToPath('resource', { resourceId: resourceId + 1}); // e.g. '/resource/2'
  next();
});
```

## To Do

  * Returned route objects should be read-only
  * Add tests for nested req.routeToPath
  * Add tests for attaching components and app.lookupRoute
  * Add ability to declare nested routes:

```javascript

app.defineRoute('resource.show', '/resource/:resourceId');
```
